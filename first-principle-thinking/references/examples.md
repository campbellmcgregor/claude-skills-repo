# First Principle Thinking Examples

## Example 1: SpaceX Rocket Reusability

**Conventional Wisdom**: Rockets are expendable because reusability is too complex and expensive

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental truth: Aerospace materials don't evaporate after one use
2. Fundamental truth: Controlled propulsive descent is physics-feasible
3. Assumption being challenged: "Recovery is more expensive than rebuilding"
4. Material cost analysis: Rocket materials cost ~$500k; launch price is $60M
5. Question: Why discard $500k of material to save recovery costs?

**First Principle Conclusion:**
If a plane can land and fly again, a rocket can too—it's an engineering problem, not a physics problem. The real question is making recovery cost less than replacement.

## Example 2: Tesla Battery Manufacturing

**Conventional Wisdom**: Battery packs will always be expensive due to complexity

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental truth: Batteries are made of cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers
2. Material cost: ~$80/kWh at commodity prices
3. Market price: $600/kWh
4. Gap analysis: $520/kWh is not materials—it's manufacturing process and margin
5. Question: How do we close the gap between material cost and market price?

**First Principle Conclusion:**
Build the machine that builds the battery. Vertical integration + manufacturing optimization can approach material cost limits. Price isn't fixed—it's a manufacturing challenge.

## Example 3: Online Education

**Conventional Wisdom**: Quality education requires physical classrooms and high teacher:student ratios

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental objective: Transfer knowledge from knowledgeable source to learner
2. Physical requirement: Information must flow; learner must process and practice
3. Assumption being challenged: Physical presence is required for quality
4. Question: What actually requires co-location vs. tradition?

**First Principle Conclusion:**
Learning requires information transfer, practice, and feedback—none of which physically require a classroom. Challenges are engagement and motivation (human factors), not information delivery.

## Example 4: Urban Transportation

**Conventional Wisdom**: Traffic congestion requires more roads or public transit

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental objective: Move people from point A to point B efficiently
2. Physical constraint: Urban surface area is limited
3. Current approach: 2D road network at ground level
4. Unused resource: 3D space (above and below ground)
5. Question: Why do we only use one layer of urban space?

**First Principle Conclusion:**
Tunnels add transportation layers without consuming surface area. Cost isn't fundamental—it's a boring technology problem. (Led to The Boring Company)

## Example 5: Restaurant Business Model

**Conventional Wisdom**: Restaurants need physical locations with full kitchen staff

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental objective: Deliver prepared food to hungry customers
2. Physical requirement: Food preparation, storage, delivery
3. Assumption being challenged: Dine-in space is essential
4. Question: What percentage of costs are the dining room vs. kitchen?
5. Material cost analysis: Rent, service staff, and ambiance vs. actual food preparation

**First Principle Conclusion:**
Ghost kitchens that only do delivery eliminate 60% of overhead (dining space, servers, ambiance) while maintaining food quality. The fundamental job is cooking, not hosting.

## Example 6: Book Publishing

**Conventional Wisdom**: Books require publishers for editing, printing, distribution, and marketing

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental objective: Connect authors with readers
2. Physical requirement: Content creation, quality control, distribution, discovery
3. Assumption being challenged: Publishers are necessary intermediaries
4. Question: Which publisher functions are fundamental vs. historically convenient?
5. Analysis: Editing is purchasable service; printing/distribution is now digital; marketing can be direct

**First Principle Conclusion:**
Self-publishing becomes viable when distribution costs approach zero (digital). Publishers' value shifts from gatekeeping to optional premium services.

## Example Template

Use this structure for analyzing your own problems:

**Conventional Wisdom**: [What everyone believes/does]

**First Principle Breakdown:**
1. Fundamental truth: [Physical/logical facts]
2. Fundamental truth: [More immutable facts]
3. Assumption being challenged: [What you're questioning]
4. Question: [Key question that exposes the assumption]
5. Analysis: [Material costs, constraints, requirements]

**First Principle Conclusion:**
[What becomes possible when reasoning from fundamentals]
