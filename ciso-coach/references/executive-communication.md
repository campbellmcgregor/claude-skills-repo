# Executive Communication Frameworks

Proven frameworks for communicating security matters to executives and board members.

## BLUF Framework (Bottom Line Up Front)

Structure for executive updates:

1. **Opening (1-2 sentences)**: State the conclusion or recommendation first
2. **Key points (2-4 bullets)**: Critical facts that support your position
3. **Action needed (if any)**: What decision or support you need
4. **Details (optional)**: Additional context if asked

**Example:**
"We need to invest $500K in MFA deployment by Q2. This will reduce account takeover risk by 90%, meet our compliance requirements, and prevent the type of incident that cost our competitor $5M last month. I need board approval for the budget increase."

## Risk Translation Model

Convert technical risks to business language:

**Technical**: "We have unpatched Log4j vulnerabilities"
**Business**: "Without this patch, we risk unauthorized access to customer data, potentially costing $2-10M in breach response, plus regulatory fines and brand damage"

**Formula**: Technical Issue → Business Impact → Financial/Operational Cost → Competitive/Regulatory Context

## The Three Questions Executives Always Ask

1. **What does this cost?** (In money, time, or opportunity)
2. **What do we get?** (In revenue protection, risk reduction, or compliance)
3. **What happens if we don't?** (The realistic worst case)

Prepare answers to all three before any executive conversation.

## Incident Communication Template

**For ongoing incidents:**
- What happened (one sentence)
- Current impact to business operations
- What we're doing about it
- When you'll hear from me next

**Avoid:** Technical root causes, detailed timelines, blame

**For post-incident:**
- What happened and why it matters
- Business impact quantified
- What we learned
- Changes we're making

## Business Enablement Framing

**Instead of:** "We need to block this to stay secure"
**Try:** "Here's how we can enable this safely: [3 options with different risk/speed tradeoffs]"

**Instead of:** "Security policy says no"
**Try:** "The risk here is [X]. If the business accepts that risk, here's how we can monitor and respond"

## Metrics That Resonate

Executives care about:
- **Time to detect/respond** (operational efficiency)
- **Coverage metrics** (% of assets protected)
- **Trend data** (are we improving?)
- **Comparison data** (vs. peers or standards)

They don't care about:
- Total vulnerabilities found
- Logs processed
- Alerts generated

## Meeting Preparation Checklist

Before any executive meeting:
- [ ] What decision or action do I need?
- [ ] What's my one-sentence ask?
- [ ] Do I have financial impact quantified?
- [ ] Can I answer "what if we do nothing?"
- [ ] Have I removed all jargon?
- [ ] Is there a simpler way to say this?
